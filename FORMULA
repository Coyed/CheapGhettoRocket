FORMULA AND METHOD
WARNING THIS IS VERY UNSTABLE AND DANGEROUS!
DO NOT ATTEMPT!

1) Start with 50ml of Vasiline (petroleum jelly) and 450ml of lighter fluid (butane or napatha). The ratio should be about 1 part petroleum and 9 parts lighter 
  fluid.
2) Slowly add the lighter fluid into the Vasiline until a clear consitency is formed, this is the chemical C35H60 Note: this is a very simplified version of 
  the chemical. This is highly combustible due to the hydrogen being set ablaze due to the behavior of burning Mg.
3) Set the C35H60 aside and somehow obtain dry, cold, Mg ribbon. Mix the COLD powder to the COLD C35H60.
