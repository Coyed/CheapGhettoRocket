Mg based fuel

==Wick==

1) Start with 150ml of Vasiline (petroleum jelly) and 350ml of lighter fluid (butane or napatha). The ratio should be about 1 part petroleum and 9 parts butane.
2) Slowly add the lighter fluid into the Vasiline until a clear fluid is formed.

==Mg extraction==

1) 11.33% magnesium by weight is in magnesium citrate salt
2) use a crucible to melt the salt 
3) the magnesium citrate has become magnesium cloride 
4) to seperate the mg from Mg+2Cl, preform electrolysis without inhaling Cl gas
5) if you started with 500 grams of magnesium citrate salt, you would now have around 56g of pure magnesium metal

==Combine==

1) grind the Mg into a coarse powder
2) add into a ceramic container (preferably glass)
3) pour the petroleum-butane liquid into the container
